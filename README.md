# [AUDRE-Project-Management-App]
This was my course project for CIS170C, Programming with Lab.

##**For my case, I chose:

Electrical Calculator: You will develop a program for an electrical contractor that will allow it to create bids for jobs. The program will be able to solve Ohm's law for any variable (I later dropped this feature as it no longer seemed relevant). In addition, the program will be able to compute the cost of the materials and labor for a job. Either aluminum or copper wire may be used, and the user can enter the cost per feet of each gauge of wire of a particular type. Additional costs for labor based on length of wire can be entered. The program should produce a report showing total cost for labor and material. Job data should be able to be saved and retrieved from a file or files.

Description of Project from Professor:

##**Objectives

The objective of the Course Project is to give you practice applying the programming techniques to a complete development project.

The actual programming problem is not too difficult, but in order to be successful with the Course Project, you will need to be able to apply the programming techniques and accomplish the analysis and design of the problem as well. This implies that you need to understand the weekly concepts as well as the programming techniques so you can apply both to the software development project.

##**Guidelines

Your final project must include all of the following. Your initial submission will start simple, and you will add features each week.

    - Input and output
    - Use of variables
    - Use of conditional statements
    - Use of loops
    - Use of modules
    - Use of arrays
    - Ability to save and retrieve data

For this project, you will decide on a program to write and develop it throughout the course. Select from one of the \[predetermined\] cases, or use a case of your choosing. If you pick your own case, it must meet the above requirements and must be approved by your instructor.

Each week, you will submit the following.

    - Current IPO chart and pseudocode
    - MS Visual Studio Project folder
    - Completed Test Plan (Screen shots of working program)

##**Weekly Breakdown

Week 1: Decide on your project program, and write a brief description of what the program will do. Prepare an IPO chart for your program. Create two or three sample screens (using Word or a drawing program) depicting what your program will look like to the user (remember that these will be console-based programs).

Week 2: Create a flowchart for a simplified version of your program. Create a working version of it based on your flowchart. This should be a working program that accepts user input, does some calculation, and shows the results. It does not have to use conditional expressions, loops, and the like.

Week 3: Add at least one conditional expression to your program.

Week 4: Add loops to validate data. Add a menu to your program that allows users to use the various features or exit the program.

Week 5: Add arrays to your program to handle more data.

Week 6: Create a hierarchy chart showing the logical components of your program. Modularize your code according to your chart using the practices learned this week. Your menu should now call individual modules to do the work of the program.

Week 7: Add the ability to save data to disk in one or more files. The menu(s) should give the user the option to save or retrieve data.
